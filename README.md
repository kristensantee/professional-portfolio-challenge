# Module 2 Challenge: Professional Portfolio Challenge
# Overview 
The challenge for this module was to create a working portfolio including work samples to provide to potential employers. The basic acceptance criteria includes nav links that toggle to matching page sections, titled images of applications, a single large titled image in relation to the others, click-to-navigate functionality for the titled images, and a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport.
# Project Description
This project includes the following Acceptance Criteria: 
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

The provided mock-up includes a header with nav links, a hero banner with caption/slogan, an About Me section, a Work section featuring tiled projects cards that glow on hover, and a Contact Me section. 
# Run and Install
The deployed Professional Portfolio Challenge can be accessed [here](https://kristensantee.github.io/professional-portfolio-challenge/). 
# How to Use the Project
The nav links in the header will direct the user to the various parts of the page that are identified by the links. The Resume link will redirect the user to my current resume which will need to be updated prior to job searching.

This project currently includes multiple placeholder images and deployed links as of the due date for this project. Going forward, I will plan to update the links, headers, images, and summary text to adequately showcase completed projects. The html and css coding includes commented tags that can quickly be activated when content becomes available and is appropriate for this display. 

Additionally, the contact email is currently redirecting to a usable address until such time that I have developed a personal website with a professional email address. The nav links in the Contact Me section direct users to my github page, the Spotify playlist of music I'm digging right now, and my personal Instagram profile.

# How to Contribute to the Project
At this time, I am looking to improve the baseline coding to be cleaner and more efficient. I have a relatively new grasp on css styling so as I learn new tips and tricks, I will be revisiting this application to update and enhance it.
