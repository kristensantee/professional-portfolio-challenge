        <h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3>
            <p>I am coming to the field of software engineering through an odyssey of jobs and locations around the world. After majoring in both History and Classics with a minor in Anthropology, I worked in a museum, helped grow a mortgage company, labored on an archaeological excavation in Italy, worked front offices for a few aesthetic surgery clinics, served as a barista in a coffee shop, tried my hand in real estate, and most recently wrapped a tenure with a large credit union. At first glance, these are widely varied fields and jobs. However, a uniting theme for all of these positions was the need for well-organized data and functional web tools to get the job done well.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before undertaking this journey, I had dabbled in small corners of the developer world without fully understanding the power that could be harnessed with a broader education. Through the completion of the UW Coding Bootcamp, I will become a full stack developer with an understanding of how those skills can be applied in a functional workplace environment. I am viewing each exercise as an opportunity to identify practical applications for these skills and to understand the expectations of developers in the field. While I do not expect this journey to be an easy one, I do know that I like to push the limits of my capabilities and this experience is sure to deliver on that front.
